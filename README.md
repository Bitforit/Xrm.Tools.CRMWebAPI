This is a prototype of an API helper for working with CRM 2016 Web API

Design goals include
 - Lightweight 
 - Simple API signatures as similar as possible across languages
 - Integrate well with Azure Active Directory / Authentication libraries but don't bake them in
 - JavaScript library to work from web resource or external application 

At this point in time this should only be used to provide feedback and demo, not for production

API signatures might break slightly between releases - you have been warned!

There are versions of the API for .NET, JavaScript, Node, Python and PHP with Java coming soon

Feedback and contributions welcome...if you are going to propose major changes open an issue first to discuss the change.
